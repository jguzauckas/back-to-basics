The goal of this project is to practice some clean coding principles and get a little more formal in how we write our code.

The tasks here are simpler than previous projects and just push you to bring back the older information and write things concretely.

Before tackling the Python file, go to `settings.md` and follow the instructions to install a formatter and get autosave set up!
